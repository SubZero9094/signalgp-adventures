# Overview

The signalgp-adventures repository holds a variety of general benchmarks/experiments specific to SignalGP. 

## SignalGP
SignalGP is a genetic programming (GP) technique designed to give evolution direct access to the event-driven programming paradigm. [Check of the wiki for more details](https://github.com/amlalejini/signalgp-adventures/wiki). 

As I write general SignalGP usage documentation, I'll try to keep this repo's wiki (linked above) up-to-date with the most recent stuff. 

## The Pipeline
In general, I'll start exploratory SignalGP work in this repository. As a result, most 'adventures' will likely be unpolished, and potentiallly out of date with the most recent versions of Empirical. 

I'll try to update things or make notes when that happens, but no promises. 

Once an adventure makes it out of the exploratory stage and it becomes its own application/experiment for a publication, it'll likely get moved to it's own repository where I will document experiment/publication-specific details. Again, I'll try to make note when this happens.
