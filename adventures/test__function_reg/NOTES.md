# Adventure Overview
I'll use this adventure to test SignalGP function regulation development. 

## Details to sweep:
- Apply minimum similarity threshold to regulation references? 
- Apply regulation modifier to regulation references?
- Should up/down regulate amount be constant? Argument-specified?
- How should we apply up/down regulation (mutiplication, addition, etc)?
